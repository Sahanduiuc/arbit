# arbit

Arbit has been an effort to apply some sort of statistical arbitrage to the equity and futures markets.  The orginal code was in Mathematica, written during a Christmas vacation in 2006.  It was ported to Matlab and later Python 2.  I moved it to Python 3 well before that was a viable language, back in the Python 3K days.  As of 2015, it uses python3, mongodb and runs on AWS.
